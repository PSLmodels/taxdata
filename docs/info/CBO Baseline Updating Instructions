This document provides instructions for updating the 'CBO_baseline.csv' file found in the
Stage I folder.

Most of the projections can be found in the CBO's 10-year Economic Projections. Those 
variables are listed under "Variables in 10-Year CBO Projections." Those not in that
file are listed separately with instructions on where/how to find/update them.

The year of the file/report the current numbers come from as well as the year of the
file/report used before the most recent update are listed for each variable. These
will need to be updated with each update of CBO_baseline.
